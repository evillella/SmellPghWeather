# SmellPghWeather
Using weather data to predict the strength of the smell of pollution

## Summary of Plan
Data has been collected from the public in the Pittsburgh region by [Smell Pittsburgh](smellpgh.org), and they have probably done a lot of cool analysis of the data. I have chosen not to read exactly what they've done until I've played with the data myself. I plan to use machine learning to predict when there will be a bad smell.

## The Smell Data
I downloaded [the smell data](./smell_reports.csv) November 3, 2019.
